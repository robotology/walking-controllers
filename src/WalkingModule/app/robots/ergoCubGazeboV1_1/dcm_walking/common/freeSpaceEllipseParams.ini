#This factor affects the reference of the unicycle. It allows switching between the specified ellipse and a smaller one to
#take into account the robot dimensions. If 0, it always considers only the specified ellipse. If greater than zero, the reference
#to the unicycle will be projected in a smaller ellipse as soon as the unicycle is no more perpendicular to the ellipse.
#Greater values make this behavior more sensitive.
conservative_factor    2.0

#This offset is subtracted from the semi_minor_axis and semi_major_axis to obtain the inner ellipse
